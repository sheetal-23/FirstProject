        <p><b>Maqbool Fida Husain</b> (17 September 1915 - 9 June 2011), commonly known as MF Husain, was a modern Indian painter of international acclaim, and a founding member of The Progressive Artists Group of Bombay (PAG).</p>
        <p>
        Husain was associated with Indian modernism in the 1940s. His early association with the Progressive Artist's Group, or "PAG of Bombay" used modern technique, and was inspired by the "new" India after The Partition of 1947. His narrative paintings, executed in a modified Cubist style, can be caustic and funny as well as serious and sombre.</p>
        
        <p>He also directed a few movies. In 1967, he received the <b>National Film Award for Best Experimental Film </b>for Through The Eyes of a Painter. In 2004, he directed Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities, a film he worked on with his artist son Owais Husain, which was screened in the March√© du Film section of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.</p>
